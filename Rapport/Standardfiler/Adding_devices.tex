\section{Inserting devices}
This section contains the description of the solution regarding adding devices to a WorkCell. The solution was heavily inspired by the XMLRWLoader from the loaders section of the RobWork library. The solution was put in a class called loader.

\subsection{General explanation of the solution}
The solution for the requirements related to insertion of devices (See need to have requirement 3) was, just like with inserting frames and geometries, divided into two parts. The first part is the interface to the user required for the user to be able to supply the necessary information needed. The second part is the process of creating and inserting the device defined by the user. The reason for this separation is the same as the one given in inserting frames and geometries section (\ref{subsec:iFramesAGeomsGE} General explanation of the solution).

\subsection{Using the loader}
The loader contains two functionalities the user should be aware of. The first functionality is a function called add. This is the function that
