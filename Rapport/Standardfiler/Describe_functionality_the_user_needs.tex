\section{Describe functionality the user needs, and sort in order of importance}

\begin{itemize}

\item Loading objects into the WC, this does not necessarily mean with a drag and drop-like motion, but rather as a proof of concept without regards to the GUI.

\item Simple browser for objects with a load button.

\item Improvement of the GUI, this means adding a drag and drop-like feature to the GUI, where the user would drag an object from the object browser window into the WC.

\end{itemize}
