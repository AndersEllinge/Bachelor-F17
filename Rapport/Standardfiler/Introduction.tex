\section{Introduction}

While looking for a project to work on for our bachelors degree, it was brought to our attention that there exists different tedious processes of editing the environment of the RobWork work space, involving reconfiguring files, unintuitive user interaction or reloading the software. RobWork is an open-source robotics software used for research and education as well as for practical robot applications. Since we (the authors), as students at the SDU Robotics section of The Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Institute, would have to get acquainted with RobWork in one way or the other, it was then decided that our bachelor project would revolve around RobWork, and thus our work would hopefully be of great help to both new and old users of RobWork. With skills and experience within software development, object oriented C++ and various programming oriented skills, the authors of this project then tried to solve and implement a solution to above mentioned tedious processes.\\

To work on this project, it was required to become familiar with RobWork, RobWorkStudio and Qt, which was a large part of this project, therefore those topics are generally explained in section~\ref{sec:generalIntroductionToTheRobWorkProject}, \ref{sec:RW_lib_and_func} and \ref{sec:qt} to give insight and a basis to understand the rest of the project. It is then recommended to read these sections before continuing to the Project Specification in section~\ref{}. After the project has been specified the report will then proceed to take the reader on a tour through the solution in section ~\ref{}. The report will then explain various elements of the solution in a proper order the following sections and reveal how these are implemented and what impact they have on the solution.
