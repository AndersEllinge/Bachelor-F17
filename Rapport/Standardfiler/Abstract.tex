RobWork has a tedious process regarding loading and inserting various objects into the WorkCell, which if simplified could be a great asset. The authors had no experience working with RobWork and thus this was acquired over the four months period from February to May that the project lasted. This includes learning how to use the RobWork library, learning to create plugins for RobWorkStudio, learning to create user interfaces using QT and gaining a better understanding of the process regarding loading and inserting various objects from seasoned users of RobWorkStudio. During this period as well, a solution to the above mentioned process was developed using methods and skills involving object oriented C++, software development and programming skills in general. A proof of concept plugin was created for RobWorkStudio, where a user can insert devices and geometric primitives with a few clicks of a mouse, furthermore the addition of removing said objects from the WorkCell was also achieved. There still exists errors and improvements to be made on the solution, however the requirements were met and a foundation for later work was laid so the project was considered a success.
