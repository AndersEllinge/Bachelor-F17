	With user interviews
		what kind of interview?

How did we find the requirements of this project?

		Define use cases.
			Black box, what the plug-in must do (not how).
				Maybe in casual form? Breif might be preferred.

	Does this involve some sort of acquiring a new set of skills?
		Yes!
			3d transforms, rw lib, qt, rws plug-in
